# You made it!

That's all there is to creating PDF documents in PDFKit. It's really quite
simple to create beautiful multi-page printable documents using Node.js!

This guide was generated from Markdown files using a
PDFKit generation script. The examples are actually run to generate the output shown
inline. The script generates both the website and the PDF guide, and
can be found [on Github](https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit/blob/master/docs/generate.js).
Check it out if you want to see an example of a slightly more complicated renderer using
a parser for Markdown and a syntax highlighter.
