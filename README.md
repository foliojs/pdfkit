# PDFKit

A JavaScript PDF generation library for Node and the browser.

## Description

PDFKit is a PDF document generation library for Node and the browser that makes creating complex, multi-page, printable
documents easy. The API embraces chainability, and includes both low level functions as well as abstractions for higher
level functionality. The PDFKit API is designed to be simple, so generating complex documents is often as simple as
a few function calls.

Check out some of the [documentation and examples](http://pdfkit.org/docs/getting_started.html) to see for yourself!
You can also read the guide as a [self-generated PDF](http://pdfkit.org/docs/guide.pdf) with example output displayed inline.
If you'd like to see how it was generated, check out the README in the [docs](https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit/tree/master/docs)
folder.

You can also try out an interactive in-browser demo of PDFKit [here](http://pdfkit.org/demo/browser.html).

## Example

```javascript
const PDFDocument = require('pdfkit');
const fs = require('fs');

// Create a document
const doc = new PDFDocument();

// Pipe its output somewhere, like to a file or HTTP response
// See below for browser usage
doc.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.pdf'));

// Embed a font, set the font size, and render some text
doc
  .font('fonts/PalatinoBold.ttf')
  .fontSize(25)
  .text('Some text with an embedded font!', 100, 100);

// Add an image, constrain it to a given size, and center it vertically and horizontally
doc.image('path/to/image.png', {
  fit: [250, 300],
  align: 'center',
  valign: 'center'
});

// Add another page
doc
  .addPage()
  .fontSize(25)
  .text('Here is some vector graphics...', 100, 100);

// Draw a triangle
doc
  .save()
  .moveTo(100, 150)
  .lineTo(100, 250)
  .lineTo(200, 250)
  .fill('#FF3300');

// Apply some transforms and render an SVG path with the 'even-odd' fill rule
doc
  .scale(0.6)
  .translate(470, -380)
  .path('M 250,75 L 323,301 131,161 369,161 177,301 z')
  .fill('red', 'even-odd')
  .restore();

// Add some text with annotations
doc
  .addPage()
  .fillColor('blue')
  .text('Here is a link!', 100, 100)
  .underline(100, 100, 160, 27, { color: '#0000FF' })
  .link(100, 100, 160, 27, 'http://google.com/');

// Finalize PDF file
doc.end();
```

[The PDF output from this example](http://pdfkit.org/demo/out.pdf) (with a few additions) shows the power of PDFKit â€” producing
complex documents with a very small amount of code. For more, see the `demo` folder and the
[PDFKit programming guide](http://pdfkit.org/docs/getting_started.html).

## Browser Usage

There are three ways to use PDFKit in the browser:

- Use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). See demo [source code](demo/browser.js) and [build script](https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit/blob/master/package.json#L56)
- Use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). See [complete example](https://github.com/blikblum/pdfkit-webpack-example).
- Use prebuilt version. Distributed as `pdfkit.standalone.js` file in the [releases](https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit/releases) or in the package `js` folder.

In addition to PDFKit, you'll need somewhere to stream the output to. HTML5 has a
[Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) object which can be used to store binary data, and
get URLs to this data in order to display PDF output inside an iframe, or upload to a server, etc. In order to
get a Blob from the output of PDFKit, you can use the [blob-stream](https://github.com/devongovett/blob-stream)
module.

The following example uses Browserify or webpack to load `PDFKit` and `blob-stream`. See [here](https://codepen.io/blikblum/pen/gJNWMg?editors=1010) and [here](https://codepen.io/blikblum/pen/YboVNq?editors=1010) for examples
of prebuilt version usage.

```javascript
// require dependencies
const PDFDocument = require('pdfkit');
const blobStream = require('blob-stream');

// create a document the same way as above
const doc = new PDFDocument();

// pipe the document to a blob
const stream = doc.pipe(blobStream());

// add your content to the document here, as usual

// get a blob when you are done
doc.end();
stream.on('finish', function() {
  // get a blob you can do whatever you like with
  const blob = stream.toBlob('application/pdf');

  // or get a blob URL for display in the browser
  const url = stream.toBlobURL('application/pdf');
  iframe.src = url;
});
```

You can see an interactive in-browser demo of PDFKit [here](http://pdfkit.org/demo/browser.html).

Note that in order to Browserify a project using PDFKit, you need to install the `brfs` module with npm,
which is used to load built-in font data into the package. It is listed as a `devDependency` in
PDFKit's `package.json`, so it isn't installed by default for Node users.
If you forget to install it, Browserify will print an error message.
